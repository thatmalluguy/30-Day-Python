File Overview: Day3.py

The file Day3.py is part of a Python programming challenge titled "30 Days of Python." 
This specific file focuses on demonstrating various arithmetic operations, variable declarations, and basic mathematical calculations in Python. 
It serves as an educational resource for beginners to understand how to perform arithmetic operations, work with different data types, and utilize variables effectively.

Key Components of Day3.py

Arithmetic Operations

The file begins with examples of basic arithmetic operations using integers:
Addition: 1 + 2
Subtraction: 2 - 1
Multiplication: 2 * 3
Division: 4 / 2 (results in a floating-point number)
Floor Division: 7 // 2 (returns the quotient without the remainder)
Modulus: 3 % 2 (returns the remainder)
Exponential: 3 ** 2 (calculates power)
Floating Point and Complex Numbers

The file demonstrates the use of floating-point numbers (e.g., 3.14 for Ï€ and 9.81 for gravity).
It also shows how to work with complex numbers, such as 1 + 1j, and how to perform operations on them.
Variable Declaration and Assignment

Variables are declared at the top of the file, with examples of integer assignments (a = 3, b = 2).
The results of arithmetic operations are stored in variables (total, diff, product, etc.) for later use.
Organizing and Printing Results

The file includes organized calculations for two sets of numbers (num_one and num_two), demonstrating how to perform and print results of arithmetic operations with labels for clarity.
Area Calculations

The file contains calculations for the area of a circle and a rectangle, showcasing how to use variables in mathematical formulas:
Area of a circle: area_of_circle = 3.14 * radius ** 2
Area of a rectangle: area_of_rectangle = length * width
Weight Calculation

It calculates the weight of an object using the formula weight = mass * gravity, demonstrating the application of arithmetic operations in real-world scenarios.
Boolean Comparisons

The file includes various boolean comparisons using relational operators (e.g., >, <, ==, !=) and logical operators (and, or, not).
It demonstrates how to compare values and check conditions, providing examples of true and false outcomes.
Membership and Identity Operators

The file also illustrates the use of membership operators (in) to check if a value exists within a string and identity operators (is, is not) to compare the identity of objects.
Conclusion

The Day3.py file is a comprehensive introduction to arithmetic operations, variable handling, and basic programming concepts in Python. 
It is designed for beginners to practice and understand how to perform calculations, use different data types, and apply logical reasoning through boolean expressions. 
The structured approach and clear examples make it an effective learning tool for those new to programming in Python.
