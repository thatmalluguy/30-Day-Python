File Overview: Day2.py

The file Day2.py is part of the "30 Days of Python" programming challenge, focusing on the concept of variables in Python.
This file serves as an educational resource for beginners to understand how to declare, assign, and manipulate variables, as well as how to work with 
different data types in Python.

Key Components of Day2.py

Variable Declaration

The file begins with the declaration of several variables that store personal information:
first_name: Stores the first name of a person (string).
last_name: Stores the last name of a person (string).
country: Stores the country of residence (string).
city: Stores the city of residence (string).
age: Stores the age of the person (integer).
is_married: Stores the marital status (boolean).
skills: A list that contains various skills (list).
person_info: A dictionary that organizes personal information in key-value pairs.
Printing Variable Values

The file includes print statements to display the values stored in the variables. This helps in understanding how to access and output variable data:
It prints the first name, last name, country, city, age, marital status, skills, and the entire person information dictionary.
It also demonstrates how to use the len() function to find the length of strings (e.g., first name and last name).
Multiple Variable Assignment

The file showcases how to declare and assign multiple variables in a single line. This is done using tuple unpacking:
first_name, last_name, country, age, is_married = 'Ananthakrishna', 'Nair', 'India', 21, False
This feature allows for more concise code and is useful for initializing several variables at once.
Data Types

The file implicitly introduces various data types used in Python:
String: Used for names, country, and city.
Integer: Used for age.
Boolean: Used for marital status.
List: Used for storing multiple skills.
Dictionary: Used for organizing personal information in a structured format.
Understanding Variable Scope

By printing the values of the variables, the file illustrates the concept of variable scope and how variables can be accessed and modified throughout the program.
Conclusion

The Day2.py file serves as a foundational introduction to variables in Python, emphasizing their declaration, assignment, and manipulation. 
It provides practical examples of how to store and display personal information, making it an effective learning tool for beginners. 
By understanding the concepts presented in this file, learners can build a solid foundation for more advanced programming topics and practices in Python.
